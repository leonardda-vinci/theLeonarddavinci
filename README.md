  <li>Music</li>
  <p>Music is just like playing mobile/computer online games, it give me a relaxing moments, chillin' and it's my stress reliever.

  <li>Websites</li>

  <li>Sleep</li>
  <p>Sleep have a biggest role in my life. If I don't consume 9+ hours sleep, I'm high, I can't focus on the things around me. The feeling you can't walk, you can't eat because you don't have enough sleep.</p>

  <li>Instruments</li>
  <p>I start playing instruments when I was grade 7. The instruments that I play is guitar and bass. I want to learn piano someday because I think is cool. I chose to play guitar because I influence by sungha jung, his fingerstyle and there a lot of people who play guitar so I think it's time to me to learn how to play guitar.</p>
